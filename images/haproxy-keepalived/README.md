A load balancer with haproxy and keepalived (VRRP) to provide high-availability networking.

### Usage

Configuration is defined as files in volumes mounted as
/usr/local/etc/haproxy.d and /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf.

* Define your local settings for haproxy under `/usr/local/etc/haproxy.d`; see [man page](https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.8/configuration.html); the entrypoint script here will concatenate multiple files.

* Define your keepalived settings in /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf; see [man page](https://www.mankier.com/5/keepalived.conf).

* If you want to override the haproxy.cfg defined in this image, mount your own as `/usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg` with read-only set.

* If you want to add `vrrp_track_process` directive in keepalived config, specify pid=host to docker (see example in docker-compose.yml)

See the [haproxy-keepalived/examples/](https://github.com/instantlinux/docker-tools/blob/main/images/haproxy-keepalived/examples) directory under this git repository to get started.

This requires NET_ADMIN privileges: keepalived will run as root (but you can specify user `haproxy` or `keepalived_script` for the `vrrp_script` directive); haproxy will downgrade itself to user `haproxy` after startup. Also, you will need the ip_vs kernel module and ip_nonlocal set on the host running docker engine:
```
echo ip_vs >>/etc/modules.conf
echo net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind=1 >/etc/sysctl.d/99-haproxy.conf
sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-haproxy.conf
```

After starting this service using [helm](https://github.com/instantlinux/docker-tools/tree/main/images/haproxy-keepalived/helm), _kubectl apply_ or _docker-compose_, you can connect to http://<host>:<port>/stats to view the haproxy stats page, with basic-auth username _haproxy_ and the password set in the secret defined below. This repo has complete instructions for
[building a kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/instantlinux/docker-tools/blob/main/k8s/README.md) where you can deploy [kubernetes.yaml](https://github.com/instantlinux/docker-tools/blob/main/images/haproxy-keepalived/kubernetes.yaml) using _make_ and customizing [Makefile.vars](https://github.com/instantlinux/docker-tools/blob/main/k8s/Makefile.vars) after cloning this repo:
~~~
git clone https://github.com/instantlinux/docker-tools.git
cd docker-tools/k8s
make haproxy-keepalived
~~~
