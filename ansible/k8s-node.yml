# Step 3: set up kubernetes worker nodes
#
# Usage:
#
#  ansible-playbook k8s-node.yml

# k8s-cplane and k8s-node are the first and third steps in cluster setup (with
# single control plane and as many worker nodes as desired) which runs
# kubeadm to provide initial installation.  See the Makefile in
# top-level k8s directory to complete the second step of installation.

# Run the k8s-cplane playbook before this one.
